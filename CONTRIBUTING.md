## Commit Message Format

This repository uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) commit message formats.

This is supported and enforced in this project with developer dependencies ([commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)) and git hooks. Install and activate these tools alongside all the dependencies with `npm i`.
